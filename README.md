# Quantization
___
This repository goes into the weeds of using **Qunato** Quantization library and using the meta-structure of Pytorch tensors to overcome any possible OOM issues with PyTorch.

- For the models which were not showing good results with **Quanto** quantization library, which is a **linear quantization** approach I have used **AWQ**.
